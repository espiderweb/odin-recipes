        <h3>What Is Chicken Tinola?</h3>
Tinola is a traditional Filipino comfort food that usually consists of broth, chicken, leafy greens, papaya, and ginger. Fish sauce is a key ingredient that lends a deliciously pungent taste. Chicken tinola is often served with rice to make a hearty meal.
This version features chayote squash and bok choy for a fresh, vibrant spin on traditional chicken soup.

<strong>How to Make Chicken Tinola</strong>

Make this warming Filipino chicken soup a part of your regular rotation. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make this top-rated recipe:
Begin gently cooking the onion and garlic in a large pot over medium heat until fragrant. Add the ginger, fish sauce, and chicken, and cook for about five minutes. Stir in the broth, squash, and seasonings before simmering until the chicken is white in the center.
Add bok choy and spinach, cooking the mixture just until the greens are wilted. Serve the soup hot by itself or paired with rice.
